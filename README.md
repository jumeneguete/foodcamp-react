### 🔹🔹Technologies
- React.js

### 🔹🔹Disclaimer
This was my very first project using ReactJS framework. I was not very familiar with none of ReactJs several possibilities and my previous reference was Vanilla Javasript only. <br>
There is no use of API in this project, that is why you will find all the items hardcoded in arrays. <br><br>
I am very proud of producing this application while learning ReactJS.<br>
Sure there are a lot of room for improvement on this project, and I may be doing it in a new repository, but this one will be kept as a reference to me. <br>
Hope it helps some begginer! <br> <br>

This project was previously implemented using only vanilla Javascrip, you can check this repository out here: https://github.com/jumeneguete/projeto-foodcamp
